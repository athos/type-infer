![build](https://github.com/athos/type-infer/workflows/build/badge.svg)

A Clojure utility to inspect static types inferred by the Clojure compiler

## Installation

Add the following to your `deps.edn` / `project.clj`:

- `deps.edn`
```
{dev.athos/type-infer {:mvn/version "0.1.2"}}
```

- `project.clj`
```
[dev.athos/type-infer "0.1.2"]
```

## Usage

### `infer`

The `infer` macro tells us the static type of the given expression inferred
by the Clojure compiler:

```clojure
(require '[type-infer.core :refer [infer]])

(infer 42) ;=> long
(infer false) ;=> java.lang.Boolean
(infer "foo") ;=> java.lang.String
```

It can take an arbitrary expression and returns its static type as long as 
the Clojure compiler can infer:

```clojure
(infer (not false)) ;=> java.lang.Boolean
(infer (/ 1 2)) ;=> java.lang.Number
(infer (if (even? 2) :even :odd)) ;=> clojure.lang.Keyword
(infer (let [x 2 y (inc x)] (* x y))) ;=> long
(infer (fn [x] x)) ;=> clojure.lang.AFunction
```

Otherwise (i.e. the compiler failed to infer the static type of the given expression),
`infer` returns `nil`:

```clojure
(infer (identity 42)) ;=> nil
(infer (if (even? 2) "foo" false)) ;=> nil
(infer cons) ;=> nil
```

The `infer` macro is mainly intended to be used for performance tuning, and is especially
useful for removing reflection warnings and taking full advantage of primitive types.

In most cases, `infer` per se is difficult to use in your function or macro.
If you want to use it in your macro, it's highly recommend to use `infer-type` below instead.

### `infer-type`

The `infer-type` fn takes two arguments: The first one is the implicit macro argument
`&env` and the second one is a symbol. To get `&env`, you need to call `infer-type` in a macro:

```clojure
(require '[type-infer.core :as ty])

(defmacro my-infer-type* [sym]
  (ty/infer-type &env sym))
 
(def ^String s "foo")
(my-infer-type s) ;=> java.lang.String

(let [x 42]
  (my-infer-type x)) ;=> long
```

Note that `infer-type` only accepts a symbol as its second argument.
If you want to pass arbitrary expression to it, you'll need to pass the expression
via an extra `let` form like the following:

```clojure
(defmacro my-infer-type [x]
  `(let [x# ~x]
     (my-infer-type* x#)))

(my-infer-type (fn [x] x)) ;=> clojure.lang.AFunction
```

Note also that due to the above limitation, the target expression of the type inference
may be evaluated at most once. This means that it is impossible (or difficult at best)
to implement macros using `infer-type` such that the input expression is never evaluated
in the expanded form.
